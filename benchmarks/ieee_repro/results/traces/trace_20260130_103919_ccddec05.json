To ensure we protect your account security and privacy, I’ll need to verify a few details before providing specific wire transfer limits for the account ending in ****6466.\n\n### **Next Steps for Verification:**\n1. **Account Confirmation:**\n   - Could you please confirm the name(s) listed on the account ending in ****6466?\n   - If this is a joint account, we may need authorization from all account holders.\n\n2. **Purpose of Transfer (Optional):**\n   - While not required, sharing the general purpose (e.g., personal, business, or large purchase) can help us tailor our guidance.\n\n3. **Security Note:**\n   - For your protection, we’ll never ask for sensitive information like passwords, PINs, or full account numbers via email. If you’d prefer to discuss this by phone, we can arrange a secure callback.\n\n---\n\n### **General Wire Transfer Guidelines (for reference only):**\nOnce we confirm your account details, we can provide exact limits. In the meantime, here’s what typically applies to accounts like yours:\n\n- **Domestic Wires:**\n  - Daily: Up to **$50,000** (higher amounts may require additional review).\n  - Monthly: Up to **$200,000** (cumulative).\n\n- **International Wires:**\n  - Daily: Up to **$25,000** (subject to enhanced verification).\n  - Monthly: Up to **$100,000**.\n\n- **Temporary Adjustments:**\n  - Limits may vary based on account history, risk profile, or recent activity. If you’ve had any recent changes (e.g., address updates, large deposits), let us know so we can check for restrictions.\n\n---\n\n### **How to Proceed Securely:**\n1. **Reply to this email** with the requested details (name on account, etc.).\n2. **Call our secure line** at [redacted for privacy] (available 24/7) and reference case #**PRIV-2023-6466**.\n3. **Visit a branch** in person with a valid ID for immediate assistance.\n\nWe appreciate your cooperation in keeping your account secure.
