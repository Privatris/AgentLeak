A detailed report outlining our conclusions is attached to this letter for your review. Based on the property's value and the duration of its unauthorized use, we propose a settlement of $1,200,000.\n\nWe invite you to respond to this proposal by [Deadline for Response, e.g., two weeks from the current date] and suggest a meeting to discuss the details further. We believe a mutually beneficial agreement can be reached through open communication and a willingness to negotiate.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter. Please do not hesitate to contact me directly if you require any additional information or wish to discuss the proposal in more detail.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]  \n[Your Title]  \n[Contact Information]\n\n**Note:** This response letter is drafted based on hypothetical information for demonstration purposes.
