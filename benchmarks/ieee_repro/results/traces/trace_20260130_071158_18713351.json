Sleep has shown some improvement, but workplace triggers remain challenging.\n- **Safety:** No acute concerns (e.g., suicidal ideation or panic attacks) were reported during this visit.\n- **Treatment Adherence:** Currently taking prescribed medications (specifics to be confirmed with the care team). Occasional missed doses noted due to forgetfulness, but no severe side effects.\n- **Context:** Workplace stress is a significant contributor to symptoms. No major life changes or trauma reported since the last visit.\n\n**Assessments:**\n- Vitals and standardized scores (e.g., GAD-7) were not provided in the available data but may be on file.

If adjustments are needed:\n  - For long-term anxiety management: Consider optimizing the current regimen (e.g., dose adjustment or alternative medication if symptoms persist).\n  - For acute relief: Use short-term strategies (e.g., as-needed medications) cautiously to avoid dependence.\n\n**2.

Supportive Care:**\n- **Therapy:** If not already in place, consider cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or other evidence-based approaches to build coping skills.\n- **Follow-Up:** Schedule a check-in within 4–6 weeks to assess progress and adjust the plan as needed.\n\n**4. Safety Net:**\n- Provide emergency resources (e.g., crisis hotlines) and encourage reaching out if symptoms worsen.\n\n---\n**Note:** All recommendations are tailored to the patient’s reported needs and should be discussed collaboratively during the",
