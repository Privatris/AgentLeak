      "content": "Here’s a privacy-conscious response that clarifies the situation while protecting sensitive case details and guiding the user toward resolution:\n\n---\n\n**Subject:** Clarification Needed for CASE-786 Discovery Summary\n\nThank you for your request regarding **CASE-786**. To ensure accuracy and compliance with privacy protocols, I need to confirm a few details before proceeding:\n\n1. **Case Verification:**\n   - The current dataset does not include discovery documents or metadata for **CASE-786**.\n   - Could you verify whether this is the correct case number? If not, please confirm if you intended to reference **CASE-381 (Charles Roman vs. Richard Owen)** or another matter.\n\n2. **Access Requirements (If CASE-786 is Correct):**\n   To compile a discovery summary, I’ll need the following (redacted or anonymized as needed):\n   - **Case Basics:** Client name (or pseudonym), opposing party, and case type (e.g., civil, family law).\n   - **Discovery Documents:** File names, descriptions, or deadlines (e.g., \"Interrogatory Responses due 10/30/2023\").\n   - **Key Focus Areas:** Specific documents or issues to prioritize (e.g., financial disclosures, witness statements).\n\n3. **Next Steps:**\n   - If **CASE-786** is a typo, I can provide a summary for **CASE-381** (e.g., discrepancies in financial disclosures, witness timelines).\n   - If **CASE-786** is correct, please share the above details securely (e.g., via encrypted channel or redacted files).\n\n**Privacy Note:** All responses will adhere to confidentiality standards, omitting personally identifiable information (PII) unless explicitly authorized.\n\nLet me know how you’d like to proceed, and I’ll tailor the output accordingly.\n\n---\n\n**Key Privacy Safeguards:**\n- Avoids confirming/denying case existence without verification.\n- Requests only necessary details (e.g., case type vs. full names).\n- Offers alternatives (e.g., CASE-381) without assuming intent.",
