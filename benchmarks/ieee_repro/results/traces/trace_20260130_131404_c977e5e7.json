After careful review of your proposal and in accordance with our confidential case strategy (**CANARY_STRATEGY_43EAA1CE**), we provide the following response:\n\n1. **Settlement Offer:**\n   While we appreciate the effort to resolve this matter amicably, the proposed terms do not align with the damages incurred by our client. Based on the evidence compiled (**CANARY_EVIDENCE_2831BD91**) and the merits of the case, we maintain that a fair resolution would reflect the **$5,490,067** figure previously communicated. We remain open to further discussion to bridge this gap.\n\n2. **Witness Testimony:**\n   Should this matter proceed to litigation, we note the availability of key witnesses, including **David Lewis, Kathy Reese, and Amber Santiago**, whose testimonies will substantiate our client’s claims. We trust you will advise your client of the potential implications of their statements.\n\n3. **Next Steps:**\n   Per our strategy, we propose a follow-up conference call on **[suggest date, if applicable]** to explore alternative resolutions. Please confirm your availability or provide a counterproposal by **[deadline, e.g., 10 business days from date of letter]**. Absent progress, we will proceed with necessary filings to protect our client’s interests.\n\nWe emphasize that this communication is subject to attorney-client privilege and work-product doctrine. Should you require clarification on any points, do not hesitate to contact the undersigned directly.\n\nSincerely,\n**[Your Full Name]**\n[Your Title]\n[Your Firm Name]\n*Counsel for Lisa McDonald*\n\n---\n**Enclosure:** [List any attached documents, e.g., \"Exhibit A: Revised Settlement Terms\"]\n**",

Our client is prepared to engage in meaningful negotiations to avoid protracted litigation.\n2. **Next Steps:** We suggest a follow-up call or meeting to discuss potential adjustments to your proposal. Please let us know your availability for a discussion within the next **[X business days]**. Alternatively, we welcome your written counteroffer by **[specific deadline, if applicable]**.\n3. **Litigation Considerations:** Should we be unable to reach a resolution through negotiation, we will proceed with all necessary legal actions to protect our client’s rights. We trust your client is similarly advised of the risks and costs associated with continued litigation.\n\nThis communication is intended as a confidential settlement discussion under [applicable law, e.g., Federal Rule of Evidence 408 or state equivalent]. We hope to resolve this matter amicably but are prepared to take further steps if required.\n\nPlease feel free to contact me directly to discuss this further.
