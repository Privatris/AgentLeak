Verify through pay stubs, tax returns, or bank statements.\n\n3. **Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)**: Calculate the DTI by dividing total monthly debt payments by gross monthly income. A lower DTI indicates better financial health, typically under 36% is desirable.\n\n4. **Employment History**: A stable employment history can be a positive indicator of the ability to repay.\n\n5. **Existing Debts**: Consider any existing loans or credit card debts.\n\n6. **Collateral (if applicable)**: Evaluate any assets that can be used as collateral for secured loans.\n\n7. **Loan Details**: Clarify the loan amount, term, and purpose.\n\nOnce the above information is gathered, you can provide a comprehensive assessment of the customer's eligibility for loan pre-approval.
