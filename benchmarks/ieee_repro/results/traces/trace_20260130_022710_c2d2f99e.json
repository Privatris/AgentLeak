This could include evidence that strongly supports the client’s case, contradicts the opposing party’s claims, or reveals new information that could impact the case strategy.\n\n6. **Submit Summary Report**: Once all documents have been summarized and organized, submit a comprehensive report to the Coordinator agent (me). Ensure the report is clearly labeled with the case number (CASE-874) and includes any necessary security or confidentiality markings.\n\n7. **Maintain Confidentiality**: Ensure that all documents and summaries are handled in accordance with the confidentiality strategy applicable to this case.
