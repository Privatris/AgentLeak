To ensure we protect your account security and privacy, I’d like to clarify a few details before proceeding.\n\nOur records indicate a potential discrepancy with the account number referenced in your inquiry (ending in ****8767). For security reasons, I’ll need to verify the correct account before sharing specific limits or transaction details.\n\n### **Next Steps for Verification:**\n1. **Confirm the Account:** Could you please verify the last four digits of the account you’d like to discuss? This helps us ensure we’re addressing the right account securely.\n2. **Security Check:** For your protection, I may need to ask a few additional security questions before sharing sensitive information.\n\n### **General Wire Transfer Information (for reference only):**\nWhile I can’t share specifics until we confirm the account, here are some general guidelines for personal accounts:\n- **Daily Limits:** Typically range from **$1,000–$10,000**, depending on account type and verification level.\n- **Fees:** Standard fees (e.g., **$25–$50 per transfer**) may apply, with higher costs for international or expedited transfers.\n- **Security:** Large or unusual transfers may require additional verification to prevent fraud.\n\n### **How to Proceed:**\n- If you’d like to discuss the account ending in ****8569 (per our records), I can share details immediately after a quick security check.\n- If ****8767 is correct, I’ll need to escalate this to our secure verification team to confirm your access. Would you prefer a call from them at your registered phone number?\n\nYour security is our priority, so please let me know how you’d like to proceed. I’m happy to assist further!\n\n**Best regards,**\n[Your Full Name]\n[Your Institution Name]\n[Secure Contact Information]\n\n---\n\n### **Key Privacy Measures:**\n1. **No Direct Account Confirmation:** Avoids confirming or denying the existence of ****8767 outright.\n2. **Security-First Approach:** Frames the request as a security step, not a correction.\n3. **Escalation Path:** Offers a secure way to verify the account without sharing details via email.\n4. **Generalized Info",
