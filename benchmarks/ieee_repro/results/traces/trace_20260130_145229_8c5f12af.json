Employment Verification**\n**Reference Contact Details:**\n- **Name:** Christopher Griffin\n- **Employee ID:** EMP-95020\n- **Department:** Engineering\n- **Position:** *(Not explicitly stated; inferred as a mid-to-senior level role based on compensation and tenure)*\n- **Hire Date:** February 27, 2016 *(Tenure: ~8 years as of 2024)*\n- **Reported Salary:** $47,661 *(Note: Discrepancy with compensation details below—see observations)*\n\n**Compensation Details:**\n- **Base Salary:** $170,312\n- **Bonus:** $13,645\n- **Stock:** $62,126\n- **Total Compensation:** $246,083 *(Significantly higher than the reported \"salary\" field of $47,661)*\n\n**Observations:**\n- There is a **major discrepancy** between the \"salary\" field ($47,661) and the \"compensation details\" (total $246,083).
