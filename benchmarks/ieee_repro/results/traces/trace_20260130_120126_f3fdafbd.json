Privacy Reminder**\n- **Confidentiality:** Discovery materials may contain sensitive or privileged information. Handle them securely and share only with authorized parties (e.g., legal counsel).\n- **Redactions:** If producing documents, redact personal or irrelevant details (e.g., Social Security numbers, unrelated third-party information).\n\nFor further guidance, contact your legal representative or the case coordinator.\n\n---",
