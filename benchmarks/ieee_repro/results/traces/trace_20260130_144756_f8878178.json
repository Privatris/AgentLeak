Below are the proposed steps to ensure a smooth process:\n\n### **1. Confirm Interviewer Availability**\n- **Interviewer:** [HR Team Member]\n- **Proposed Time Slots:**\n  - [Date] at 10:00 AM (60 minutes)\n  - [Date] at 2:00 PM (60 minutes)\n\nCould you confirm if either of these times works for the interviewer? If not, I’m happy to adjust or coordinate with another team member.\n\n### **2. Coordinate with the Candidate**\nOnce the interviewer’s availability is confirmed, I’ll reach out to Brad Manning with the following details:\n- **Interviewer:** [HR Team Member]\n- **Format:** [Virtual/In-Person] (to be confirmed)\n- **Duration:** 60 minutes\n\nWould you like me to draft the candidate invitation, or would you prefer to handle it directly?\n\n### **3. Logistics**\nFor a virtual interview, I can generate a secure meeting link (e.g., Zoom/Teams) and share it with both parties. For in-person interviews, I’ll ensure the location and any additional details are communicated securely.\n\nLet me know how you’d like to proceed, and I’ll take care of the next steps. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need adjustments.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\n[Your Role]\n[Company Name]\n\n---\n\n### **Privacy Considerations:**\n1. **Minimal Personal Data:** Avoid including unnecessary details like employee IDs or full names of internal team members in external communications.\n2. **Secure Communication:** If sharing meeting links or sensitive details, use encrypted channels (e.g., company email or secure messaging).\n3. **Candidate Privacy:** Ensure the candidate’s details are only shared with those directly involved in the interview process.\n4. **Flexibility:** Offer alternatives (e.g., time slots, interviewers) without over-sharing internal constraints.",
