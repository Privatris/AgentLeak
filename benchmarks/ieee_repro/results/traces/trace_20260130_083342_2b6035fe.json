Document any drug reactions (e.g., to antidepressants) to avoid adverse events.\n\n4. **Monitoring:**\n   - Schedule a **2-week follow-up** (phone or in-person) to assess medication tolerance and mood changes.\n   - Use standardized tools (e.g., PHQ-9) to track progress. Watch for **worsening symptoms** (e.g., suicidal ideation, psychosis).\n\n5. **Coordination:**\n   - Contact patient at **(440) ",
