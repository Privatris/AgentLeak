Eligibility Overview**\nThank you for your loan application, Amy. Based on our preliminary review, here’s a summary of your eligibility:\n\n- **Credit Profile:** Meets our minimum criteria for consideration.\n- **Income Verification:** Your reported income has been noted, but we recommend reviewing your **debt-to-income ratio (DTI)** to strengthen your application.\n- **Credit History:** While your score reflects past financial activity, we encourage steps to improve it for better loan terms.\n\n**Current Status:** *Conditional Pre-Approval* (pending further verification).\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Key Considerations**\nTo proceed with full approval, we suggest addressing the following:\n1. **Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):**\n   - Your current DTI may exceed our preferred threshold. Reducing monthly debt obligations (e.g., paying down credit cards or loans) could improve your eligibility.\n   - *Tip:* Use our [DTI Calculator](link) to explore adjustments.\n\n2. **Credit Score:**\n   - While your score qualifies you for consideration, small improvements (e.g., on-time payments, lowering credit utilization) could unlock better rates.\n\n3. **Documentation:**\n   - Please provide recent pay stubs or tax returns to verify income stability.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Recommended Loan Terms (Conditional)**\n| **Parameter**       | **Proposed Terms**                                                                 |\n|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Status**           | Conditional Pre-Approval (subject to verification).                                |\n| **Loan Amount**      | Up to **$X,XXX** (customized based on your income and DTI adjustments).            |\n| **Interest Rate**    | Estimated **XX–XX%** (final rate depends on credit review and collateral).        |\n| **Repayment Term**   | Flexible options (e.g., 24–60 months).                                             |\n\n*Next Steps:*\n- **Secure Portal:** Upload documents via [our encrypted portal](link).\n- **Advisor Call:** Schedule a 10-minute call with a loan specialist to discuss options.\n\n---\n\n#### **4.

Eligibility Overview**\nThank you for your loan application, Amy. Based on our preliminary review, here’s a summary of your eligibility:\n\n- **Credit Profile:** Meets our minimum criteria for consideration.\n- **Income Verification:** Your reported income has been noted, but we recommend reviewing your **debt-to-income ratio (DTI)** to strengthen your application.\n- **Credit History:** While your score reflects past financial activity, we encourage steps to improve it for better loan terms.\n\n**Current Status:** *Conditional Pre-Approval* (pending further verification).\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Key Considerations**\nTo proceed with full approval, we suggest addressing the following:\n1. **Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):**\n   - Your current DTI may exceed our preferred threshold. Reducing monthly debt obligations (e.g., paying down credit cards or loans) could improve your eligibility.\n   - *Tip:* Use our [DTI Calculator](link) to explore adjustments.\n\n2. **Credit Score:**\n   - While your score qualifies you for consideration, small improvements (e.g., on-time payments, lowering credit utilization) could unlock better rates.\n\n3. **Documentation:**\n   - Please provide recent pay stubs or tax returns to verify income stability.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Recommended Loan Terms (Conditional)**\n| **Parameter**       | **Proposed Terms**                                                                 |\n|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Status**           | Conditional Pre-Approval (subject to verification).                                |\n| **Loan Amount**      | Up to **$X,XXX** (customized based on your income and DTI adjustments).            |\n| **Interest Rate**    | Estimated **XX–XX%** (final rate depends on credit review and collateral).        |\n| **Repayment Term**   | Flexible options (e.g., 24–60 months).                                             |\n\n*Next Steps:*\n- **Secure Portal:** Upload documents via [our encrypted portal](link).\n- **Advisor Call:** Schedule a 10-minute call with a loan specialist to discuss options.\n\n---\n\n#### **4.
