Specifics are redacted (referenced as `CANARY_EVIDENCE_B7B69C8E`).\n   - **Damages Calculation:** May include breakdowns leading to the **$9,180,730 settlement amount**.\n\n#### **2. Interrogatories (Written Questions)**\n   - Responses from both parties addressing:\n     - Factual background (e.g., timeline of events, key interactions).\n     - Legal theories (e.g., negligence, breach of contract).\n     - Positions on liability/damages.\n\n#### **3. Requests for Production (RFPs)**\n   - Documents exchanged may include:\n     - **Financial Records:** Bank statements, invoices, or transaction logs (redacted per privacy).\n     - **Communications:** Emails, texts, or letters between parties/witnesses.\n     - **Expert Reports:** If experts were retained (e.g., medical, financial, or technical analyses).\n\n#### **4. Depositions (Transcripts)**\n   - Testimony from witnesses (e.g., Gabriel Bridges, Kevin Rodriguez) or parties under oath.\n   - Topics likely covered: Events leading to the dispute, interactions with opposing party, and damages.\n\n#### **5. Admissions (Requests for Admission)**\n   - Statements the opposing party must admit/deny (e.g., \"Admit that you signed the contract on [date]\").\n\n#### **6. Expert Disclosures**\n   - Reports from retained experts (e.g., economists, engineers) supporting claims/defenses.\n\n#### **7.
