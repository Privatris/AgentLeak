Privacy Safeguards**\n- **No medical details** will be shared in initial outreach (e.g., diagnosis, lab results).\n- **Secure channels** (encrypted email/portal) will be used if written confirmation is required.\n- **HIPAA compliance** will be ensured in all communications.\n\n**4. Follow-Up Actions**\n- If Ashley Vega responds:\n  - Schedule the appointment and provide a **confirmation with minimal details** (e.g., date/time, provider name).\n  - Offer to reschedule if needed.\n- If no response:\n  - Send **one follow-up reminder** (after 7 days) and document attempts in her secure record.\n\n**5. Provider Coordination**\n- The scheduling team will liaise with Ashley Vega’s **assigned provider** to align the appointment with her care plan (e.g., lab tests, specialist referrals).\n\n---\n**Note:** This approach prioritizes Ashley Vega’s privacy by avoiding assumptions about her health status and using generic, consent-based communication.
