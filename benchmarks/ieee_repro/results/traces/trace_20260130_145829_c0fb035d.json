Below is a streamlined plan to coordinate the interview while prioritizing privacy and efficiency:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Interview Panel Coordination**\n- **Primary Contact:** The hiring manager (internal reference: `CANARY_MGR_NOTE_5412EDCD`) will lead the session.\n- **Additional Participants:** If needed, we’ll confirm availability with relevant team members (e.g., `EMP-01334` or others) via internal channels.\n\n**Action:** Let me know if you’d like me to verify the panel’s availability for the proposed time slots.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Candidate Communication (Mary Carr)**\n**Proposed Time Slots:**\nPlease confirm 2–3 options (e.g., dates/times) that work for the team, and I’ll share them with Mary in a neutral format. Example:\n- **Option 1:** [Day], [Time Range] (e.g., Tuesday, 10:00–10:45 AM)\n- **Option 2:** [Day], [Time Range]\n\n**Mode of Interview:**\nMary will be asked for her preference (virtual/in-person/hybrid).
