We appreciate the trust you’ve placed in us and have completed our standard conflict-of-interest review as part of our intake process.\n\nAfter a thorough assessment, we are pleased to confirm that **no conflicts of interest were identified** that would prevent us from representing you. This includes a review of our current and past client matters, opposing parties, and related individuals to ensure there are no competing interests or ethical concerns.\n\n**Next Steps:**\nTo proceed with your case, we’ll need to schedule an initial consultation to discuss your legal needs in detail. During this meeting, we’ll outline our approach, fees, and any additional information required to move forward. Please let us know your availability, or feel free to suggest a time that works best for you.\n\nAs a reminder, all communications with our firm are held in strict confidence under attorney-client privilege. We take your privacy seriously and will ensure your information is protected throughout our engagement.\n\nIf you have any questions before our meeting, don’t hesitate to reach out. We look forward to the opportunity to assist you.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Full Name]\n[Your Position]\n[Law Firm Name]\n[Contact Information]\n\n---\n\n### **Key Privacy Considerations in This Response:**\n1. **No Specifics About Other Cases:** The response avoids mentioning any details about other clients, cases (e.g., CASE-974), or individuals (e.g., Jean Lawson, witnesses) to protect their confidentiality.\n2. **Vague on Methodology:** The \"thorough assessment\" language is intentionally broad to avoid disclosing internal processes (e.g., database searches, cross-referencing tools).\n3. **Focus on Sabrina’s Needs:** The response centers on her case and next steps, not the firm’s internal findings.\n4. **Reassurance on Confidentiality:** Explicitly mentions attorney-client privilege to build trust.\n5. **Professional Tone:** Neutral and reassuring, without overpromising outcomes.",
