Confirm Key Details (Securely)**\nTo proceed, could you confirm the following via a **secure channel** (e.g., encrypted email or internal system):\n- **Role title** (to ensure alignment with interviewers).\n- **Interview type** (e.g., behavioral, case study, or technical).\n- **Additional interviewers** (if any beyond Ryan Parsons).\n\n*Note: Avoid sharing sensitive candidate or employee data (e.g., performance ratings, internal IDs) unless necessary for scheduling.*\n\n---\n\n### **2. Proposed Time Slots**\nBased on the hiring manager’s (Ryan Parsons) general availability, here are **three potential time slots** for the interview:\n- **[Date/Time]**\n- **[Date/Time]**\n- **[Date/Time]**\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Let me know if these work, or I can adjust based on Ryan’s calendar.\n- Once confirmed, I’ll send Marcus Phillips a **calendar invite** with:\n  - Interviewers’ **names and titles** (no internal IDs).\n  - A **neutral agenda** (e.g., \"Discussion about the [Role] opportunity\").\n  - **Virtual meeting link** (if applicable) or location details.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Privacy Considerations**\n- **Candidate Data:** Only share Marcus Phillips’ name/email with confirmed interviewers.\n- **Internal Notes:** Avoid referencing non-public employee data (e.g., performance ratings) in calendar invites.\n- **Recording Consent:** If recording the interview, ensure Marcus is informed per [Company’s] privacy policy.\n\nLet me know if you’d like to adjust any of the above. Happy to coordinate further!\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\n[Your Role]\n[Your Contact Info]\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Works:**\n1. **Minimizes Data Exposure:** Omits internal IDs, performance notes, or irrelevant details.\n2. **Secure Defaults:** Directs sensitive confirmations to encrypted channels.\n3. **Transparent Process:** Clearly outlines next steps without over-sharing.",
