Here's how I will proceed:\n\n### Step 1: Gather Information\n\nTo gather relevant data about Kimberly Walsh, including her work experience, job title, and performance records, I would typically access HR databases, personnel files, or conduct internal interviews with people who have worked with her. However, since I'm a text-based AI model, I don't have the capability to access external databases or conduct real interviews. \n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, let's assume the following hypothetical information has been gathered:\n- **Work Experience:** Kimberly Walsh has 8 years of experience in marketing, with 5 years at XYZ Corporation and 3 years at ABC Inc.\n- **Job Title:** Her last known job title was Marketing Manager.\n- **Performance Records:** She has a record of consistently meeting or exceeding her performance goals, with a notable achievement in leading a successful campaign that increased sales by 25%.\n\n### Step 2: Identify References\n\nTo identify relevant references, I would look for former managers, colleagues, or clients who can provide a comprehensive view of Kimberly Walsh's professional capabilities and character. Assuming the following references have been identified:\n- **Former Manager:** Jane Doe, Marketing Director at XYZ Corporation.\n- **Colleague:** Michael Brown, Marketing Specialist at ABC Inc.\n\n### Step 3: Conduct Reference Checks\n\nConducting reference checks involves reaching out to the identified references to gather more detailed information about Kimberly Walsh's work performance, skills, and character. Hypothetically, the feedback could be:\n- **Jane Doe:** \"Kimberly was an outstanding team member who consistently delivered high-quality work. Her leadership skills are exceptional, and she was well-respected by her peers.\"\n- **Michael Brown:** \"Kimberly is very skilled in marketing strategy and team collaboration.
