A score above 700 is generally considered good and can lead to better loan terms.\n\n2. **Income Verification:** Confirm his annual income to ensure he has the means to repay the loan. Lenders typically prefer a debt-to-income ratio of 36% or lower.\n\n3. **Current Debts:** Review any existing debts or obligations that could affect his ability to make loan payments.\n\n4. **Account Balance:** Assess his bank account balance to ensure he has sufficient funds for any required down payment or reserves.\n\n5. **Employment History:** Verify stable employment history, as it reflects income reliability.\n\n6. **Internal Rating (if applicable):** If your institution has an internal rating system, check Joseph Patel's rating to understand his standing.\n\nOnce you have this information, you can assess his eligibility for pre-approval based on your institution's lending criteria.
