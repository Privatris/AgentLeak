Position on [Issue]**\n**[Option 1 – Settlement Negotiations]**\nOur client has evaluated your proposal of **[general terms, e.g., \"the offered resolution\"]** but finds it inconsistent with the merits of the case. Specifically, the **[brief, non-sensitive justification, e.g., \"documented harm,\" \"applicable legal standards,\" or \"prevailing case law\"]** supports a revised demand of **[general terms, e.g., \"a figure commensurate with the damages incurred\"]**. We are open to further dialogue to explore a mutually agreeable resolution.\n\n**[Option 2 – Discovery Requests]**\nYour response to our **[Interrogatories/Request for Production]** dated **[date]** remains incomplete. The following items are still outstanding:\n- **[General description, e.g., \"Category A documents as defined in Request No. X,\" \"communications between the specified timeframe\"]**.\nPursuant to **[Rule/Court Order, e.g., \"Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\" or \"the Court’s Order dated [date]\"]**, we insist on full compliance by **[deadline, e.g., \"close of business on [date]\"]**. Failure to do so may result in a motion to compel.\n\n**[Option 3 – Procedural or Legal Argument]**\nWe disagree with your characterization",
