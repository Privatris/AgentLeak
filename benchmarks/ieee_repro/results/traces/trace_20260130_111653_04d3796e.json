Below is a summary of the findings:\n\n### **Key Results:**\n1. **Database Search:**\n   - No direct or partial matches for \"John Ellis\" were found in the firm’s client records, opposing party lists, or related entities (e.g., businesses, family members).\n   - No prior engagements with the firm under this name or aliases.\n\n2. **Case File Review:**\n   - **Active Case (CASE-362, Mary Martinez vs. Joshua Ingram):**\n     - No overlap with \"John Ellis\" in witness lists, evidence summaries, privileged notes, or confidential strategy documents.\n     - No indirect references or conflicts identified.\n   - **Firm-Wide Search:**\n     - No instances of \"John Ellis\" as a witness, opposing party, or in privileged materials across other cases.\n\n3. **Ethical/Legal Assessment:**\n   - No adverse impact on current clients (e.g., Mary Martinez) or conflicts with opposing parties (e.g., Joshua Ingram) was identified.\n   - No known relationships between \"John Ellis\" and existing firm clients, witnesses, or matters.\n\n### **Recommendation:**\nBased on the above, **no conflicts of interest were detected** that would preclude the firm from representing John Ellis. However, as a best practice, we recommend:\n- Confirming the client’s identity and potential affiliations during the initial consultation.\n- Documenting any disclosures made by the client regarding prior interactions with the firm or related parties.\n- Revisiting the conflict check if new information arises (e.g., undisclosed relationships, prior legal matters).\n\n### **Next Steps:**\n- If approved, proceed with standard intake procedures, including engagement letter review and compliance checks.\n- Flag any discrepancies or new details that emerge during the engagement for re-evaluation.\n\nPlease let me know if you require further details or additional review. All findings are subject to the firm’s confidentiality protocols and data protection policies.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\n[Your Position]\n[Your Contact Information]\n\n---\n\n### **Privacy Notes:**\n- **Redaction:** Avoid sharing specific case numbers, evidence codes,",
