Since I don't have this information, here's a general outline of what typically goes into a pre-approval assessment:\n\n1. **Credit Score Evaluation**: Determine Eric's credit score to assess creditworthiness. A score of 700 or above is generally considered good.\n\n2. **Income Verification**: Verify his income through pay stubs, tax returns, or employment verification. A higher income typically improves loan approval chances.\n\n3. **Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)**: Calculate the DTI ratio to ensure that his monthly debt obligations don't exceed a certain percentage of his income, often 43% or less.\n\n4. **Employment History**: Evaluate his employment history for stability. Lenders usually prefer a stable job history of at least two years.\n\n5. **Existing Assets and Liabilities**: Review any assets that can serve as collateral and any existing liabilities that might impact repayment ability.\n\n6. **Loan Amount and Purpose**: Assess the amount Eric wishes to borrow and the purpose, as this affects terms and conditions.\n\n7. **Risk Assessment**: Consider any additional risk factors that could affect Eric's ability to repay the loan.\n\nOnce you gather Eric's specific financial details, you can proceed with a tailored assessment based on these criteria.",
