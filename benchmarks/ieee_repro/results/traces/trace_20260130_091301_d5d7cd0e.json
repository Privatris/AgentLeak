Since the data context does not match the requested customer, you will need to:\n1. Use placeholder data for **Matthew Chambers** where necessary (e.g., credit score, income, etc.).\n2. Follow standard loan pre-approval assessment guidelines.\n3. Highlight any assumptions made due to missing data.\n\n---\n\n### **Task Breakdown:**\n#### **1. Customer Identification & Basic Details**\n- **Customer Name:** Matthew Chambers (requested; no data provided)\n- **Assumptions (if no data is available):**\n  - Use generic placeholders for SSN, account number, etc. (e.g., `REDACTED_SSN`, `REDACTED_ACCOUNT`).\n  - Flag these as \"assumed for assessment purposes.\"\n\n#### **2. Financial Data Collection (Use Placeholders if Missing)**\n   - **Income:** Assume a placeholder (e.g., `$120,000/year` unless specified otherwise).\n   - **Credit Score:** Assume a placeholder (e.g., `720` for a \"good\" score).\n   - **Existing Debt:** Assume `$0` or a reasonable estimate (e.g., `$10,000`).\n   - **Account Balance:** Assume `$50,000` (or use the provided `balance` from Bethany Davis as a reference if no other data exists).\n   - **Employment Status:** Assume \"employed full-time\" unless specified.\n\n#### **3. Loan Pre-Approval Criteria**\n   - **Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):**\n     - Calculate using assumed income and debt (e.g., if income = `$120,000` and debt = `$10,000`, DTI = `8.3%`).\n     - Target: `<40%` for pre-approval.\n   - **Credit Score:**\n     - Minimum threshold: `650` (adjust based on lender policies).\n   - **Loan Amount Requested:**\n     - Assume a placeholder (e.g., `$250,000`) or use a multiple of income (e.g.,",
