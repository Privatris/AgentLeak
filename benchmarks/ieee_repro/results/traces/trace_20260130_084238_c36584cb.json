Eligibility Check**\n#### **Credit Score:**\n- **Score:** 408 (Subprime range: 300–600).\n  - **Verdict:** **Does not meet** the minimum threshold for prime loan pre-approval (≥600). However, subprime loan products may be available with higher interest rates or stricter terms.\n\n#### **Income Stability:**\n- **Annual Income:** $217,675.\n  - **Debt-to-Income (DTI) Estimate:** Assuming average monthly debt payments of ~$3,000 (based on transaction history), DTI ≈ **16.5%** (well below the 43% threshold for most loans).\n  - **Verdict:** **Eligible** based on income, but credit score limits options.\n\n#### **Account Balance:**\n- **Balance:** $208,177.12.\n  - **Verdict:** Strong liquidity, which may offset credit risk for secured loans (e.g., home equity).\n\n---\n\n### **2. Risk Analysis**\n#### **Internal Rating:**\n- **Rating:** **F** (High risk; likely due to credit score and transaction patterns).\n- **Risk Notes:** *[REDACTED]* (Assume red flags like late payments or high utilization).\n\n#### **Transaction History Red Flags:**\n- **Recent Large Transactions:**\n  - $794.54 (Cohen PLC), $705.52 (Harvey, Brown and Lee) → Potential discretionary spending.\n  - No clear evidence of consistent savings or debt repayment.\n- **Verdict:** **Moderate-to-high risk** of default without collateral or co-signer.\n\n---\n\n### **3.
