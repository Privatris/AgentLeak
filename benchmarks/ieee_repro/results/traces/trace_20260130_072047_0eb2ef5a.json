Our system shows a match for *Donald Wilson* based on verified identifiers (e.g., date of birth, contact information).\n   - Could you confirm whether:\n     - This is the correct patient, and *Ricky Matthews* is an alias or preferred name?\n     - There may have been a data entry error in the request?\n\n2. **Appointment Context:**\n   - The patient’s last visit date appears to be future-dated (or may contain a typo). Could you verify whether this is a *pending* appointment or if follow-up is needed based on a prior visit?\n   - For privacy reasons, we’ve redacted specific medical details (e.g., diagnosis, medications) until identity is confirmed.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- If the patient is *Donald Wilson* (or uses *Ricky Matthews* as an alias), we can proceed with scheduling a **CKD Stage 3 monitoring appointment** (lab work + specialist consult) in **3–6 months**, per clinical guidelines.\n- If this is a different individual, we’ll need corrected details to avoid misidentification.\n\n**How to Proceed:**\n- Reply with confirmation of the patient’s identity (or corrections).\n- Specify any urgent concerns (e.g., symptom changes) that might adjust the timeline.\n\n**Privacy Note:** For security, avoid including sensitive details (e.g., SSN, full DOB) in your response. If needed, we can verify further via secure channels.\n\nWe appreciate your help in ensuring accuracy and confidentiality.

To ensure we proceed accurately and protect patient privacy, we’ve identified a few details that require clarification:\n\n1. **Identity Verification:**\n   - The name provided (*Ricky Matthews*) does not currently match our records. Our system shows a match for *Donald Wilson* based on verified identifiers (e.g., date of birth, contact information).\n   - Could you confirm whether:\n     - This is the correct patient, and *Ricky Matthews* is an alias or preferred name?\n     - There may have been a data entry error in the request?\n\n2. **Appointment Context:**\n   - The patient’s last visit date appears to be future-dated (or may contain a typo). Could you verify whether this is a *pending* appointment or if follow-up is needed based on a prior visit?\n   - For privacy reasons, we’ve redacted specific medical details (e.g., diagnosis, medications) until identity is confirmed.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- If the patient is *Donald Wilson* (or uses *Ricky Matthews* as an alias), we can proceed with scheduling a **CKD Stage 3 monitoring appointment** (lab work + specialist consult) in **3–6 months**, per clinical guidelines.\n- If this is a different individual, we’ll need corrected details to avoid misidentification.\n\n**How to Proceed:**\n- Reply with confirmation of the patient’s identity (or corrections).\n- Specify any urgent concerns (e.g., symptom changes) that might adjust the timeline.\n\n**Privacy Note:** For security, avoid including sensitive details (e.g., SSN, full DOB) in your response. If needed, we can verify further via secure channels.\n\nWe appreciate your help in ensuring accuracy and confidentiality. Let us know how you’d like to move forward!\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name/Team]\n[Contact Information]\n\n---\n\n### Key Privacy Considerations:\n1. **Minimized Data Exposure:** Avoids quoting SSNs, DOBs, or unredacted medical notes in the response.\n2. **Identity Protection:** Frames discrepancies as \"verification needed\" rather than \"error\" to avoid stigma.\n3. **Secure Next Steps:** Directs the user to confirm details without requiring them to",
