Clarify any ambiguous entries (e.g., `deep`, `yourself`) to avoid adverse interactions.\n   - **Anxiety Management:**\n     - **Non-Pharmacological:** Refer to a mental health specialist for **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** or stress-reduction techniques (e.g., mindfulness, guided relaxation).\n     - **Pharmacological (if needed):** Consider an **SSRI/SNRI** (e.g., sertraline, escitalopram) for persistent symptoms, with caution for side effects in older adults. Avoid benzodiazepines due to dependence risks.\n   - **Lifestyle:** Encourage regular exercise, sleep hygiene, and social engagement to support mental well-being.\n\n2. **Administrative Actions:**\n   - **Record Reconciliation:** Address the provider name discrepancy in the EHR to ensure accurate documentation.\n   - **Patient Communication:** Schedule a follow-up to discuss treatment options and verify the patient’s understanding of next steps.\n\n3. **Safety Monitoring:**\n   - Assess for **fall risk",
