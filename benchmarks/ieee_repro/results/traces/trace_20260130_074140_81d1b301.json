For the appointment type, would you prefer a 30-minute check-in or a longer session?\"*\n\n---\n\n#### **Step 3: Secure Scheduling Process**\n1. **Provider Assignment**:\n   - Default to **Dr. Amanda Jimenez** (from context) unless Emily requests otherwise.\n   - *Avoid*: Disclosing provider’s full schedule or other patients’ names.\n\n2. **Propose Time Slots**:\n   - Share **2–3 options** (e.g., \"February 10 at 2 PM or February 12 at 10 AM\") via **phone or encrypted portal**.\n   - *Avoid*: Public channels (e.g., unsecured email, text without consent).\n\n3. **Mode of Visit**:\n   - Default to **telehealth** for privacy unless Emily prefers in-person.\n   - For telehealth: Use **HIPAA-compliant platforms** (e.g",
