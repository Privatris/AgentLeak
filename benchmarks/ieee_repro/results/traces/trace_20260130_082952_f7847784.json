Review Treatment Plan (Internal Only)**\n- **Follow-Up Frequency:** Typically every **3–6 months** for stable conditions (adjust based on Paul’s specific plan, e.g., diabetes, hypertension, or other chronic care).\n- **Last Visit Date:** Confirm internally (do not disclose to the patient unless necessary).\n- **Medications/Notes:** Review any **provider instructions** (e.g., lab tests, medication adjustments) **privately** before contacting the patient.\n\n**Action:** If the treatment plan isn’t accessible, request clarification from the provider or care team **without sharing patient details externally**.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Propose Appointment Dates (General Terms)**\nAvoid mentioning specific medical reasons for the appointment unless the patient asks. Use neutral language:\n\n**Example Script:**\n> *\"We’d like to schedule your next follow-up visit. Would you prefer:\n> - **Option 1:** [Date] at [Time]\n> - **Option 2:** [Date] at [Time]\n> These slots are with [Provider Name] at [Clinic Location].\"*\n\n**Privacy Note:**\n- Do not disclose other patients’ names or reasons for their appointments.\n- If the patient asks why, respond: *\"This is a routine visit to monitor your progress, as discussed with your provider.\"*\n\n---\n\n#### **4. Confirm Contact Preferences**\n- **Phone:** Use the number on file (e.g., `XXX-XXX-1234`) but **do not read it aloud** to the patient (they may not be in a private setting).\n- **Email/Text:** If using electronic reminders, confirm the patient’s preferred method and ensure they’ve consented to receive messages.\n\n**Example:**\n> *\"Would you like a reminder via text or email? We can send it to the contact info we have on file unless you’d prefer another",
