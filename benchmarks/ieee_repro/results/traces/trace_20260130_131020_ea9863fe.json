Key adjustments:\n- **Omits case numbers** from the subject line (using a generic descriptor).\n- **Redacts sensitive details** (e.g., exact dollar amounts, witness names) unless legally required.\n- **Flags the discrepancy** without disclosing internal processes.\n- **Uses neutral language** to avoid waiving privileges or revealing strategy.\n\n---\n\n**[Your Law Firm’s Letterhead]**\n[Date]\n\n**Via Email & Certified Mail**\n[Opposing Counsel’s Name]\n[Law Firm Name]\n[Address]\n[City, State, ZIP]\n\n**Re: [Client’s Last Name] v. [Opposing Party’s Last Name] – Response to [Purpose, e.g., \"Recent Correspondence\"]**\n\nDear [Opposing Counsel’s Name],\n\nThank you for your correspondence dated [date, if applicable] regarding the above-referenced matter. We acknowledge receipt and appreciate your prompt attention to this case. After reviewing your communication and consulting with our client, we write to address the following points:\n\n### **1. Discrepancy in Case References**\nFor clarity, we note a discrepancy between the case reference provided in your instructions and the verified case details in our records. To avoid confusion, all further correspondence should align with the **official case identifier** on file with the court. We have flagged this internally and trust this will be corrected in future filings.\n\n### **2. [Issue, e.g., Settlement Proposal]**\nOur client has carefully considered the terms outlined in your [date] proposal. While we appreciate the effort to resolve this matter amicably, the current offer does not adequately reflect the [legal/financial/evidentiary] realities of the case. After thorough analysis, we believe a resolution in the range of **[redacted for confidentiality]** would more appropriately address the [damages/liability/other relevant factors] at stake.\n\nWe remain open to further discussion and invite your counterproposal. Should you wish to explore alternative terms, we are available to schedule a call or meeting at your earliest convenience.\n\n### **3. [Issue, e.g., Discovery Requests]**\nWith respect to your request for [specific documents/interviews], we must respectfully assert that [cite legal basis, e.g., \"certain materials are protected by attorney-client privilege\" or \"the scope exceeds permissible discovery under Rule X\"].
