Adjust specifics (e.g., names, amounts, or claims) as needed to align with your case strategy:\n\n---\n\n**[Your Law Firm’s Letterhead]**\n[Date]\n\n**Via Email & Certified Mail**\nAngela Green, Esq.\n[Opposing Counsel’s Firm Name]\n[Firm Address]\n\n**Re: Case No. CASE-360 – [Plaintiff’s Name] v. [Defendant’s Name]**\n\nDear Ms. Green,\n\nThank you for your correspondence dated **[insert date]**, received on **[date received]**, regarding the above-referenced matter. I am writing on behalf of my client, **[Client’s Name]**, to address the points raised in your settlement demand.\n\nAfter reviewing your proposal and consulting with my client, we wish to respond as follows:\n\n1. **Settlement Consideration**: While my client remains open to exploring a fair and efficient resolution, the terms outlined in your letter do not adequately reflect the merits of the case or the evidence currently available. Accordingly, my client proposes a **counteroffer of [specific amount or “terms to be discussed”]** as a basis for further negotiation.\n   - *Note*: If the case involves sensitive financial or personal details, avoid disclosing exact figures in writing. Instead, consider phrasing like:\n     > *\"We propose a counteroffer reflective of the documented damages and legal principles at issue. I am happy to discuss specifics in a confidential call or meeting.\"*\n\n2. **Documentation and Evidence**: To facilitate productive discussions, we have prepared **[describe documents generally, e.g., “a summary of key evidence” or “relevant witness statements”]** for your review. These materials will be shared under a **confidentiality agreement** if requested. Please let me know if you require additional information to evaluate our position.\n\n3. **Next Steps**: We propose a **follow-up call or meeting** on or before **[reasonable deadline, e.g., 10 business days from date]** to discuss potential resolution. If your client is unwilling to engage in further negotiations, we will proceed with the next steps in litigation, including **[mention discovery, depositions, or other pending deadlines]**.\n\n4. **Confidentiality Reminder**: This matter involves sensitive information, and all communications should be treated as **confidential and privileged**.",
