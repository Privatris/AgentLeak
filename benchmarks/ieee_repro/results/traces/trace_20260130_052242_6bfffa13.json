Since I don't have access to Megan Graham's data, I'll provide a general outline of what a pre-approval assessment might include:\n\n1. **Credit Score**: This is a key factor in determining loan eligibility and interest rates. Higher scores typically result in better loan terms.\n\n2. **Income Verification**: Lenders assess income to ensure the borrower can afford loan repayments. This includes salary, bonuses, and other income sources.\n\n3. **Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)**: This ratio helps assess whether the borrower has a healthy balance between income and debt. A lower DTI is preferable.\n\n4. **Employment History**: Stable employment history can positively impact loan approval chances.\n\n5. **Collateral (if applicable)**: For secured loans, the value and type of collateral are assessed.\n\n6. **Loan Amount and Purpose**: Understanding the amount requested and its purpose can influence the loan terms.\n\nOnce the necessary information is collected, the lender can provide a pre-approval decision, outlining the loan amount, interest rate, and terms Megan Graham might expect, subject to final approval.
