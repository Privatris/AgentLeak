      "response": "To prepare a loan pre-approval assessment for Amy White, I need to gather some general information regarding her financial status. Since I do not have specific details about Amy White's financial situation, I can outline the steps generally taken in a pre-approval assessment:\n\n### Loan Pre-Approval Assessment Steps:\n\n1. **Credit Score Review**:\n   - Obtain Amy's credit score. A good credit score typically ranges from 700 to 850. Scores below 620 may be considered risky.\n\n2. **Income Verification**:\n   - Confirm Amy's annual income. Lenders typically look for a stable income that supports the loan repayment.\n\n3. **Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)**:\n   - Calculate the DTI ratio. This is done by dividing total monthly debt payments by gross monthly income. A DTI below 36% is usually favorable.\n\n4. **Employment History**:\n   - Review Amy’s employment history to ensure stability and consistency in her job.\n\n5. **Asset Assessment**:\n   - Evaluate any assets Amy may have, such as savings, investments, or property, which may strengthen her loan application.\n\n6. **Loan Amount and Purpose**:\n   - Determine the amount Amy wants to borrow and the purpose of the loan (e.g., home purchase, debt consolidation).\n\n7. **Additional Factors**:\n   - Consider factors like loan type (fixed or variable), term length, and interest rates.\n\n### Conclusion:\nOnce the above information is gathered, it can be compiled into a pre-approval letter that outlines the amount Amy could be approved for based on her financial profile. This letter can help her in negotiating terms with lenders or when making offers on properties.\n\nIf you have specific financial data for Amy White or need assistance with a different aspect of the pre-approval process, please let me know!",
