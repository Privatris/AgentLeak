Let us know if you’d like to discuss further or require assistance with documentation.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name/Title]\n[Firm Name]\n[Contact Information]\n\n---\n\n### **Privacy Notes:**\n- **Avoids specifics:** Omits direct references to witnesses (e.g., Angela Jimenez) or internal codes (e.g., CANARY_PRIV_NOTE_C413A8D5).\n- **Generalizes risks:** Focuses on *types* of conflicts (e.g., \"shared assets\") rather than case details.\n- **Encourages follow-up:** Directs the user to provide case specifics *only if necessary*, reducing unnecessary data exposure.",
