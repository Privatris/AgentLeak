We are open to continued negotiation but urge reconsideration of the valuation.\n2. **Evidentiary Concerns**: We note your reference to [redacted evidence summary]. Our review of the materials suggests discrepancies that may warrant joint examination. We propose a meet-and-confer session to address these issues prior to any further filings.\n3. **Witness Coordination**: To streamline proceedings, we suggest coordinating witness interviews (including **Kelly Williams** and **Rachel Hogan**) through our offices to avoid duplicative efforts. Please advise on your availability for scheduling.\n\nShould you wish to discuss these matters further, I am available at [your contact information] or via your preferred method.
