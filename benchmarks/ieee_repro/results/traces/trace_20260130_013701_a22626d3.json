This may require accessing external systems or databases since the provided data context does not contain this information for DISP-093219.\n\n2.  **Fetch Transaction History**: Using the account number XMPJ28601767873880, I will retrieve the transaction history for Susan Knight. The provided transaction history includes the following transactions:\n    *   Williams-Mitchell: $850.19\n    *   Pham, Sanders and Allen: $967.48\n    *   Baker PLC: $130.20\n    *   Lynch, Dunn and Ortiz: $380.17\n    *   Richard-Howe: $621.80\n\n    Without the specific details of the disputed transaction, I will need to rely on external information to identify the transaction in question.\n\n3.  **Verify Customer Information**: I will use the provided customer details to verify Susan Knight's identity and her relationship with the disputed transaction. The key information includes:\n    *   Name: Susan Knight\n    *   Account Number: XMPJ28601767873880\n    *   Account Balance: $197,270.42\n    *   Credit Score: 765\n    *   Income: $288,650\n\n    Ensuring the customer's contact information is up-to-date will be crucial for any follow-up required during the investigation.\n\n4.  **Gather Merchant Information**: Once the merchant involved in the dispute is identified, I will gather any relevant communication or transaction records related to the dispute. Due to the lack of dispute details in the provided data, external systems or databases will need to be accessed for this information.\n\n5.  **Conduct Investigation**: A thorough investigation will be conducted, taking into account the customer's claim, any response from the merchant, and evidence provided by either party. The investigation will also involve checking for any patterns or previous disputes that could be relevant to the case.\n\nGiven the limitations in the provided data context, the investigation will require accessing external systems or databases to gather necessary information for a thorough and accurate assessment of the dispute DISP-093219.",
