For full context, refer to the secure internal report.\n\nLet us know if further clarification is required.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name/Team]\n[Your Contact Information]\n\n---\n\n**Why This Works:**\n- **Privacy-Focused:** Omits direct account/credit details and avoids speculative language.\n- **Actionable:** Highlights next steps without overpromising outcomes.\n- **Professional:** Balances transparency with confidentiality.",
