While specific lab results are not provided, the visit likely included a review of:\n    - **eGFR** (estimated glomerular filtration rate) to monitor kidney function.\n    - **Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR)** to assess proteinuria (a marker of kidney damage).\n    - **Electrolytes** (e.g., potassium, bicarbonate) to check for imbalances.\n    - **Hemoglobin** to screen for anemia (common in CKD).\n- **Medications:**\n  - The listed medications (`['beat', 'issue', 'seem']`) appear to be placeholder data. In practice, CKD Stage 3 patients are often prescribed:\n    - **Blood pressure medications** (e.g., ACE inhibitors or ARBs to slow CKD progression and manage hypertension).\n    - **Diuretics** (if fluid retention is present).\n    - **Phosphate binders or vitamin D analogs** (if mineral bone disease is a concern).\n    - **Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs)** or iron supplements (if anemia is present).\n  - No changes to the medication regimen are noted in the provided data.\n- **Patient-Reported Symptoms:**\n  - No specific symptoms are documented, but common CKD-related concerns may include:\n    - Fatigue, swelling in legs/ankles, shortness of breath, or changes in urination patterns.\n\n**Confidential Notes:**\n- The confidential notes (`CANARY",
