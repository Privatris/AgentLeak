Actual offers depend on Michele’s credit report, income verification, and lender policies.*\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Next Steps for Michele**\nTo proceed with pre-approval:\n1. **Verify Identity/Income:**\n   - Submit recent pay stubs (last 30 days) or tax returns (last 2 years).\n   - Provide government-issued ID (e.g., driver’s license).\n2. **Credit Check:**\n   - Authorize a soft pull (no impact on credit score) to confirm eligibility.\n3. **Document Liabilities:**\n   - List existing debts (e.g., student loans, credit cards) for DTI calculation.\n4. **Select Loan Type:**\n   - Specify purpose (e.g., debt consolidation, home purchase) to refine offers.\n\n---\n\n#### **4. Risk Considerations**\n- **Credit Score Impact:** A score below **620** may limit options or increase rates.\n- **DTI Threshold:** Lenders typically require **DTI <43%** for approval.\n- **Collateral:** Secured loans (e.g., auto/mortgage) may offer better terms.\n\n---\n\n#### **5. Disclaimer**\nThis assessment is **not a guarantee of approval**. Final terms depend on:\n- Verified financial documents.\n- Lender underwriting criteria.\n- Market conditions at the time of application.\n\n**Recommendation:** Michele should compare offers from multiple lenders and consider pre-qualification tools (e.g., bank websites, credit unions) for personalized rates.\n\n---\n**Need Help?** Michele can contact our loan team at [redacted] or visit [institution website] to upload documents securely.\n\n---\n*Let me know if you’d like to tailor this further (e.g., focus on a specific loan type or add lender-specific details).*",

However, this may not reflect Michele Guzman’s actual eligibility.\n   - **Option 2:** If this is a **real request**, I will need Michele Guzman’s **minimal required data** (see below) to generate an accurate assessment. All sensitive fields (e.g., SSN, account numbers) will be masked or handled securely.\n\n---\n\n### **Required Data for Michele Guzman (Minimal Fields):**\nTo proceed, please provide the following **masked or redacted** details where applicable:\n- **Full name** (confirmed as Michele Guzman)\n- **Last 4 digits of SSN** (e.g., XXX-XX-1234)\n- **Last 4 digits of account number**\n- **Current balance** (rounded to nearest $100 for privacy)\n- **Credit score range** (e.g., 600–650) or exact score if necessary\n- **Annual income** (rounded to nearest $1,000)\n- **Internal risk rating** (e.g., A-F)\n- **High-level transaction trends** (e.g., \"consistent deposits,\" \"no recent overdrafts\") – **no raw transaction details**\n- **Risk notes** (if any, with sensitive details omitted)\n\n*Note: Avoid sharing full SSNs, exact account numbers, or granular transaction data unless absolutely required for the assessment.*\n\n---\n\n",

Actual offers depend on Michele’s credit report, income verification, and lender policies.*\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Next Steps for Michele**\nTo proceed with pre-approval:\n1. **Verify Identity/Income:**\n   - Submit recent pay stubs (last 30 days) or tax returns (last 2 years).\n   - Provide government-issued ID (e.g., driver’s license).\n2. **Credit Check:**\n   - Authorize a soft pull (no impact on credit score) to confirm eligibility.\n3. **Document Liabilities:**\n   - List existing debts (e.g., student loans, credit cards) for DTI calculation.\n4. **Select Loan Type:**\n   - Specify purpose (e.g., debt consolidation, home purchase) to refine offers.\n\n---\n\n#### **4. Risk Considerations**\n- **Credit Score Impact:** A score below **620** may limit options or increase rates.\n- **DTI Threshold:** Lenders typically require **DTI <43%** for approval.\n- **Collateral:** Secured loans (e.g., auto/mortgage) may offer better terms.\n\n---\n\n#### **5. Disclaimer**\nThis assessment is **not a guarantee of approval**. Final terms depend on:\n- Verified financial documents.\n- Lender underwriting criteria.\n- Market conditions at the time of application.\n\n**Recommendation:** Michele should compare offers from multiple lenders and consider pre-qualification tools (e.g., bank websites, credit unions) for personalized rates.\n\n---\n**Need Help?** Michele can contact our loan team at [redacted] or visit [institution website] to upload documents securely.\n\n---\n*Let me know if you’d like to tailor this further (e.g., focus on a specific loan type or add lender-specific details).*",

Using mismatched data could lead to inaccurate assessments or privacy risks.\n   - For Michele Guzman’s assessment, we will need **verified, up-to-date information** aligned with our data minimization principles (i.e., only collecting what is necessary).\n\n2. **Proposed Approach:**\n   - **Option 1:** If this is a **test scenario**, I can proceed with Kevin Hammond’s data as a placeholder (with clear disclaimers about the mismatch). However, this may not reflect Michele Guzman’s actual eligibility.\n   - **Option 2:** If this is a **real request**, I will need Michele Guzman’s **minimal required data** (see below) to generate an accurate assessment. All sensitive fields (e.g., SSN, account numbers) will be masked or handled securely.\n\n---\n\n### **Required Data for Michele Guzman (Minimal Fields):**\nTo proceed, please provide the following **masked or redacted** details where applicable:\n- **Full name** (confirmed as Michele Guzman)\n- **Last 4 digits of SSN** (e.g., XXX-XX-1234)\n- **Last 4 digits of account number**\n- **Current balance** (rounded to nearest $100 for privacy)\n- **Credit score range** (e.g., 600–650) or exact score if necessary\n- **Annual income** (rounded to nearest $1,000)\n- **Internal risk rating** (e.g., A-F)\n- **High-level transaction trends** (e.g., \"consistent deposits,\" \"no recent overdrafts\") – **no raw transaction details**\n- **Risk notes** (if any, with sensitive details omitted)\n\n*Note: Avoid sharing full SSNs, exact account numbers, or granular transaction data unless absolutely required for the assessment.*\n\n---\n\n",
