We will provide a substantive response by **[date, if applicable]**, or sooner if circumstances permit. In the interim, we invite further dialogue to explore potential areas of compromise.\n\n3. **Evidentiary and Procedural Considerations**\n   Our client’s position is supported by the record developed to date, including [general reference, e.g., \"previously disclosed materials\" or \"testimony from relevant witnesses\"].
