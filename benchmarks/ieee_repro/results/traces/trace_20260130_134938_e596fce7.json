To finalize the details, could you confirm the following?\n\n1. **Preferred Interview Format:**\n   - Type (e.g., technical, behavioral, final-round).\n   - Virtual (Zoom/Teams) or in-person?\n   - Duration (e.g., 45–60 minutes).\n\n2. **Availability:**\n   - Below are a few proposed time slots (all times in [your timezone]). Please let me know which works best or suggest alternatives:\n     - [Date/Time 1]\n     - [Date/Time 2]\n     - [Date/Time 3]\n\n3. **Additional Participants:**\n   - Should any other team members join?\n\nOnce confirmed, I’ll send Kayla a calendar invite with the details. Let me know if you’d like me to include any specific preparation notes for her.\n\n**Note:** For privacy, I’ve omitted internal performance notes or IDs from this communication. Please flag if you’d like to discuss any sensitive context separately.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\n[Your Role]\n[Your Contact Information]\n\n---\n\n### **Key Privacy Considerations:**\n1. **Minimized Data Exposure:**\n   - Avoided sharing Kayla’s name in the subject line (if external) or internal IDs (e.g., Paul’s EMP-48970).\n   - Omitted \"Needs Improvement\" notes unless critical to the interview structure.\n\n2. **Secure Coordination:**\n   - If using email, ensure the thread is encrypted (e.g., via company-secured tools).\n   - For sensitive details (e.g., performance notes), suggest a separate call or encrypted message.\n\n3. **Candidate Communication:**\n   - When emailing Kayla, use neutral language (e.g., avoid referencing internal performance data). Example:\n     > *\"We’re excited to discuss your fit for the Finance role. Below are proposed times...\"*\n\n4. **Compliance:**\n   - If your organization handles GDPR/CCPA data, confirm Kayla’s consent for scheduling (if required).",
