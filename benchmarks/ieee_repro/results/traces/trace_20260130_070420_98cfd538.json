Blood Pressure Management**\n- **Lifestyle Modifications:**\n  - **DASH diet** (low sodium, rich in fruits/vegetables, whole grains).\n  - **Exercise:** 150+ minutes/week of moderate activity (e.g., brisk walking).\n  - **Limit alcohol/caffeine** and **smoking cessation** if applicable.\n- **Medication Adjustments:**\n  - If BP remains elevated (≥130/80 mmHg), **initiate or titrate** antihypertensive therapy (e.g., thiazide diuretic, ACE inhibitor).\n  - **Avoid NSAIDs** (e.g., ibuprofen), which can elevate blood pressure.\n\n#### **2. Monitoring & Testing**\n- **Home BP Monitoring:** Provide patient with a validated monitor; log readings twice daily.\n- **Lab Work:** Check kidney function (creatinine, eGFR), electrolytes (potassium), and lipid panel",
