This could be due to unauthorized transactions, incorrect charges, goods or services not received, or other reasons.\n\n5. **Investigation**: Conduct a thorough investigation based on the information gathered. This may involve reviewing transaction logs, communicating with merchants, checking for any security breaches, or analyzing customer transaction history for similar disputes.\n\n6. **Gather Evidence**: Collect any evidence that supports or refutes the customer's claim. This could include receipts, emails, delivery confirmations, or any other form of documentation relevant to the transaction in dispute.\n\n7. **Summarize Findings**: Compile a detailed report summarizing the dispute investigation. Include the transaction details, customer's claim, evidence found, and the outcome of the investigation. If the dispute is deemed valid, outline the steps to be taken to resolve the issue, such as refunding the customer or adjusting their account.\n\n8. **Resolution Proposal**: Based on the findings, propose a resolution to the dispute.

However, the customer's claim of not authorizing the transaction complicates the issue.\n\n### Resolution Proposal\nBased on the findings, a proposed resolution could involve:\n1. The bank contacting \"Green Inc.\" to verify the shipment details and confirm if the goods were indeed sent to the customer.\n2.
