To ensure accuracy and protect patient privacy, we’d like to verify a few details before proceeding:\n\n1. **Patient Identity:**\n   Our records show an active treatment plan for **Andrew Dominguez** (DOB: 12/21/2005), but your request referenced \"Aaron Hall.\" Could you confirm:\n   - Is this the same patient (e.g., legal name change, nickname)?\n   - If not, please provide the correct patient’s full name and date of birth for verification.\n\n2. **Appointment Context:**\n   - **Purpose:** Follow-up for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (30–60 minutes).\n   - **Timeframe:** We recommend scheduling between **April 2–May 2, 2026**, unless clinical urgency (e.g., recent HbA1c ≥9%) requires an earlier date.\n   - **Provider:** Default is the patient’s primary care provider (PCP) under insurance **INS-79772781**. An endocrinologist may be needed if the patient uses specific medications (e.g., SGLT2 inhibitors) or has recent complications.\n\n3. **Next Steps:**\n   - **Reply securely** to this message with:\n     - Confirmation/correction of the patient’s name and DOB.\n     - Any updates to medications, allergies, or special instructions (e.g., travel-related care).\n   - Once verified, we’ll propose available time slots and send a secure confirmation link to the patient’s registered contact method (phone/SMS).\n\n**Privacy Note:**\n- We’ve redacted sensitive details (e.g., medications) in this message. For full security, avoid sharing personal health information (PHI) via unencrypted channels.\n- If you’re not the patient or their authorized representative, please disregard this message and notify us immediately.\n\n**Contact Us:**\nFor urgent matters, call our secure line at [Clinic Phone] (M–F, 9 AM–5 PM) and reference case #**2026-DM-FU-01**.\n\nWe appreciate your cooperation in keeping patient data safe.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\n[Your Clinic Name]\n[Clinic",
