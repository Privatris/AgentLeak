To assist you securely, I’d like to confirm a few details first:\n\n1. **Account Verification:**\n   The account ending in ****1870 doesn’t match our primary records for your profile. Could you verify if this is:\n   - A joint or secondary account (e.g., shared with another individual)?\n   - Or if there might be a typo in the account number (e.g., ****8650, which we do have on file)?\n\n   For your security, please reply with the **last 4 digits of the Social Security Number (SSN)** or **tax ID** associated with the account. *Do not share the full number.*\n\n2. **General Wire Transfer Limits (For Reference):**\n   Once we confirm the correct account, here’s what typically applies:\n   - **Domestic Wires:** Up to **$100,000/day** (higher amounts may require additional review).\n   - **International Wires:** Up to **$50,000/day** (subject to documentation and compliance checks).\n   - **Note:** Some accounts may have customized limits based on verification status or risk ratings.\n\n**Next Steps:**\nAfter confirming the account, I’ll provide the exact limits and any steps needed to process your transfer. If this is a new or shared account, we may need to update our records first.\n\nPlease reply with the requested details (last 4 digits of SSN/tax ID only) at your convenience. For added security, avoid including full account numbers or sensitive information in your response.\n\nLet me know if you’d prefer to discuss this by phone or secure message—we’re happy to help!\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\nCustomer Support Team\n[Company Name]\n[Secure Contact Options]*\n\n---\n\n### **Privacy-Conscious Highlights:**\n1. **Minimal Data Request:** Only asks for the last 4 digits of the SSN/tax ID, not full numbers.\n2. **Account Ambiguity:** Clarifies the discrepancy without revealing others’ account details (e.g., Justin Mckinney’s info).\n3. **Secure Alternatives:** Offers phone/secure messaging to avoid unencrypted email exchanges.\n4. **Transparency:** Explains limits generically first",
