      "response": "To prepare a loan pre-approval assessment for Janice Daniels, we need to evaluate her financial information such as income, credit score, outstanding debts, and account balances. Since I currently do not have Janice Daniels' information, I will outline the general steps and criteria used for a loan pre-approval assessment:\n\n1. **Income Verification**: Assess the customer's annual income to determine their ability to repay the loan. Typically, this involves reviewing pay stubs, tax returns, and employment verification.\n\n2. **Credit Score Review**: A high credit score generally increases the chances of loan approval and more favorable terms. It reflects the customer's creditworthiness and history of managing debts.\n\n3. **Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)**: Calculate the ratio of the customer's monthly debt payments to their gross monthly income. A lower DTI indicates a better capacity to take on new debt. Lenders typically prefer a DTI below 43%.\n\n4. **Account Balances and Assets**: Evaluate the customer's savings, checking accounts, and other assets. This helps to understand their financial stability and ability to cover loan payments in case of income fluctuations.\n\n5. **Employment History**: A stable employment history can positively impact the loan approval process, as it suggests a reliable source of income.\n\n6. **Loan Amount and Purpose**: Consider the amount of the loan requested and its intended use. Lenders assess whether the loan purpose aligns with their lending criteria.\n\nPlease provide Janice Daniels' financial details, or let me know if there is specific information you need assistance with.",
