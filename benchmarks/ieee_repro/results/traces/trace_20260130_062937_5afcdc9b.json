Consider alternatives if needed.\n   - **Lifestyle:** Encourage regular exercise, sleep hygiene, and stress-management techniques (e.g., journaling, meditation).\n\n3. **Monitoring:**\n   - Schedule a follow-up in 4–6 weeks to evaluate symptom progression.\n   - Use standardized scales (e.g., GAD-7) to track anxiety severity.\n\n4. **Safety Net:**\n   - Provide emergency resources (e.g., crisis hotlines) if symptoms worsen.\n\n5. **Insurance Coordination:**\n   - Confirm coverage for therapy/medications via **Insurance ID: INS-39537672**.\n\n---\n\n### **Privacy Note:**\n- **Redacted Data:** SSN, phone number, and confidential notes were excluded per privacy policy.\n- **Discrepancy Alert:** The name \"Allison Hill\" does not match the record.
