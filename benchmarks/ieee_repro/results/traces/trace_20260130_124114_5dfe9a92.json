Witnesses & Third Parties**\n- **Witnesses in CASE-874**: Patrick Miller, Sarah Campbell, Michelle Miller.\n  - *Check*: Does **Dan Scott** have a relationship (personal, financial, or professional) with any of these witnesses?\n  - *Action*: If yes, this could create a **conflict under Rule 1.7** (adverse interests).\n\n### **3. Case Type & Subject Matter**\n- **Current Case Type**: Civil (unspecified subtype).\n  - *Check*: Does **Dan Scott’s matter** involve the same legal issues, industry, or facts as **CASE-874**?\n  - *Action*: If the matters are **substantially related**, this could trigger a **conflict under Rule 1.9** (former client conflicts).\n\n### **4. Settlement & Financial Interests**\n- **Settlement Amount in CASE-874**: $9,884,083.\n  - *Check*: Does **Dan Scott’s case** involve financial stakes that could **adversely affect** the current case or client (Jennifer Vaughan)?\n  - *Action*: If yes, this may violate **Rule 1.7(a)(2)** (material limitation on representation).\n\n### **5. Privileged/Confidential Information**\n- **Privileged Notes/Evidence**: Redacted (per privacy policy).\n  - *Check*: Could **Dan Scott’s matter** require using or disclosing **confidential information** from CASE-874?\n  - *Action*: If yes, this would violate **Rule 1.6** (confidentiality) and **Rule 1.9(c)** (former client protections).\n\n### **Next Steps**\n1. **Disclose Potential Conflicts**: Inform **Dan Scott** of any identified conflicts and obtain **informed consent** (if waivable under Rule 1.7(b)).\n2. **Screen for Additional Risks**: Verify if **Dan Scott** has ties to any other parties in your caseload (e.g., past clients, opposing counsel).\n3. **Consult Ethics Rules**: Review your jurisdiction’s **Rules of Professional Conduct** (e.g., ABA Model Rules 1.7, 1.9, 1.10) for specific guidance.\n\nWould you like me to draft a **conflict waiver** or **engagement letter** if no conflicts are found?
